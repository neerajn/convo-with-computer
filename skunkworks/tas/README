Problem statement:
Write a code to implement a concurrent server
Problem Description: You need to design and develop a client-
server program.
Server's role: is to offer the following services
1. testprime
2. nextprime
3. nextnprimes
4. getdate
5. filetestoperation
Client's role: is to consume the services offered by the server
Note: Solve this problem using processes (no threading)
Expectations:
1. The program should work
2. It should be efficient
3. It should be scalable
Usage: we run the server program first, so that the server is ready
to offer the intended services. And then when we run the client
program on a different computer it should display the list of
services available on the server.... like below (on the client box)
List of Services
1. testprime
2. nextprime
3. nextnprimes
4. getdate
5. filetestoperation
6. exit
Enter your choice:

Assumptions:

========================================================================================
How to run:
1) Run make
2) client and server binaries are created in the same folder as the makefile for now.
